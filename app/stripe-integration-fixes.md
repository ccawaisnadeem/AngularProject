# Stripe Integration Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix Stripe integration issues and implement additional required features.

## 1. Fixed "Not a Valid URL" Error

### Issue:
The error "Stripe error: Not a valid URL" was caused by invalid image URLs being sent to Stripe.

### Fix:
- Added URL validation using the `IsValidImageUrl` method
- Only including valid image URLs in Stripe checkout request
- Properly validating the frontend URL configuration

## 2. Added Tax Calculation

### Issue:
Products were being displayed without tax in the checkout.

### Fix:
- Added 10% tax calculation in the StripeCheckoutController:
  ```csharp
  decimal taxRate = 0.10m; // 10% tax
  decimal basePrice = item.Price;
  decimal taxAmount = basePrice * taxRate;
  decimal totalPrice = basePrice + taxAmount;
  ```
- Added tax rates to the Stripe LineItems to show tax details in checkout:
  ```csharp
  TaxRates = new List<string> { "txr_1OBcXvL1qOrMw4UxXuX1ueNn" }
  ```
  Note: You'll need to replace this with your actual tax rate ID from your Stripe account.

## 3. Implemented Cart Clearing After Successful Payment

### Backend Changes:
- Added implementation for `HandleSuccessfulPayment` method
- Makes API calls to your OrderController and CartController
- Uses HttpClient to communicate internally with your other controllers

### Frontend Changes:
- Updated CheckoutSuccessComponent to call `cartStateService.clearCart()`
- Added order record creation after successful payment
- Improved error handling for cart clearing operations

## 4. Added Order Service Integration

- Added code to create an order record after successful payment
- Ensures order history is maintained even if webhook fails
- Proper error handling to ensure users still see success message

## 5. Added Email Confirmation

- Added placeholder email confirmation method
- Ready to be integrated with an actual email service provider

## How to Test Your Integration

1. **Restart your backend**
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Restart your frontend**
   ```
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Make a test purchase**
   - Add items to cart
   - Go through checkout flow
   - Complete payment with Stripe test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - Verify you're redirected to the success page
   - Check that cart is emptied
   - Verify order appears in order history

## Important Notes

1. **Tax Rate ID**: Replace `"txr_1OBcXvL1qOrMw4UxXuX1ueNn"` with your actual tax rate ID from your Stripe dashboard.

2. **Stripe API Key**: Make sure your API keys are properly set in your configuration.

3. **Webhook Configuration**: For production, you should properly configure Stripe webhooks to handle events asynchronously.

4. **Backend URLs**: The internal API calls use the current request's scheme and host, which should work for most setups, but may need adjustment for complex deployments.

5. **Email Implementation**: The email sending is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual email service.

## Troubleshooting

- **If webhook fails**: The frontend still creates an order record as a backup
- **If cart clearing fails**: Check your CartController implementation 
- **If order creation fails**: Check your OrderController implementation and database schema
